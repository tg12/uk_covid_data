Looking at the UK stats on COVID19 with Python

I've always been interested in this area, whether it be stock data or similar. I thought it would serve as a useful tool to tell if if we are indeed flattening this curve. 

A great shout-out to these people for providing me with the tools necessary to do this.

covid_data.py ---> gets the data and draws some simple graphs
covid_ltsm.py ---> input the data.csv but the model might need tweaking currently.
